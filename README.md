# Portfolio
In this repository you get access to the codes that i used to create my portfolio. Basically i used 3 languages CSS,HTML,JAVA SCRIPT and connected a google sheet too. This is the link to see how my portfolio looks : https://pradeepth-portfolio.netlify.app/
To attach google sheets to the website you need two set of javascript codes il drop that file too so that you guys can copy it from there the file names are script2.js,googleform.js.
